# Cafebabe Lite

Cafebabe is an user-friendly java bytecode editor. It supports editing multiple files at once. Many features have been adopted from JByteMod, including the control flow grapher. Using Cafebabe you don't have to create or edit frames manually, they will automatically be regenerated at exporting, without the requirement of library jar files. Method descriptors will automatically be reversed to java-syntax and access can be changed without knowing access-values.
Try catch blocks are automatically implemented into the bytecode and the in-editor help makes editing easy.
Note that this version is not completed yet and may not support some features. If you encounter bugs, please report them by opening an issue!
